# Guide to replicating Dictionary results

List of analysis scripts required:
- "dictionary_method_w_all_terms.R"
- "compute_levay_enns_2yr_ma_corr.R"
- "compute_levay_enns_2yr_ma.R"

## Levay-Enns

### Table 1

The numbers in the Levay-Enns row of Table 1, with the exception of the two-year moving average correlation ("Corr (2yr MA)"), come from the output file "metrics_for_levay_enns_dict_as_indicator_of_explicit_article.csv". This output file was generated by the analysis script "dictionary_method_w_all_terms.R".

The two-year moving average correlation ("Corr (2yr MA)") is based on output in "time_trend_by_one_mention_and_ppn_keywords.csv", which is also generated by "dictionary_method_w_all_terms.R". After generating that output, the correlation based on a two-year moving average can be computed with the script "compute_levay_enns_2yr_ma_corr.R".

### Figure 6

The time trend for the Levay-Enns dictionary method plotted in Figure 6 is based on output in "time_trend_by_one_mention_and_ppn_keywords.csv", generated by "dictionary_method_w_all_terms.R". After generating that output, the two-year moving average can be computed with the script "compute_levay_enns_2yr_ma.R".

## McCall

### Table 1

The numbers in the McCall row of Table 1, with the exception of the two-year moving average correlation ("Corr (2yr MA)"), come from the output file "mccall_dict_explicit_or_implicit_metrics.csv". This output file was generated by the analysis script ""
